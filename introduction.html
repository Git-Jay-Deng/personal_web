                            <p class="drop-cap">I am a software engineer who came to Beijing for university in 2010. Since graduating, I have been actively involved in software development here for nearly 10 years. Throughout this decade, I have worked on numerous projects encompassing various domains, including back-end, front-end, big data, and artificial intelligence. With each project came new breakthroughs and achievements. However, despite my experience, I still consider myself a perpetual learner - One is never old to learn new skills. Currently, I am independently exploring the applications of AI in advertising and anti-cheating measures. It is my sincere hope to make progress alongside individuals who share similar interests.</p>



                            <p>My work experience can be divided into two stages. Prior to 2018, I primarily focused on Java back-end development and React front-end development. During this period, I worked on relatively simple projects such as CRM, mobile office, financial management, etc. This stage provided me with a wealth of knowledge in computer science and allowed me to gain proficiency in various back-end and front-end frameworks. By exploring the source code of Spring and Netty, I developed a deeper understanding of software programming style and design patterns while also cultivating a strong interest in elegant code design. Moving forward on my software development journey, my focus lies in creating highly available and concurrent programs. Throughout this phase, I constantly seek new challenges to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. Additionally, these jobs served as opportunities for me to explore different career paths and find the direction for future professional growth through continuous experimentation.</p>



                            <p>The second stage spans from 2018 until now, during which I have been actively engaged in Java development, Python development, big data processing, and exploring the realm of artificial intelligence at Digital Union. These past six years have undoubtedly posed as the most challenging period since my graduation.</p>

                            <h5><dt><strong> Challenge  </strong></dt></h5>

                            <p>My first project in Digital Union is DSP. Previously, I had limited access to such a vast advertising traffic. I am truly grateful for this opportunity and took the initiative to assume more responsibilities by frequently requesting from the team leader. The main challenge of this project was ensuring stable service for 10 billion AD requests per day while maintaining a response latency of less than 100ms for each request. I joined this project right from its first version and actively contributed towards subsequent launches by implementing various optimizations. These included utilizing local inverted index to expedite AD library searches, optimizing program performance to enhance single service capacity, and employing elastic services for dynamic expansion and contraction. Three versions have been optimized just to improve performance. After the service is stable, it can undertake an average 10 billion requests daily, and the average delay of a single request is controlled within 60ms. In order to improve the effect of advertising, the last version of optimization began to explore artificial intelligence. I utilized machine learning and neural network to predict CTR, so as to improve the click-through rate and post-click conversion rate. Later, I explored CTR estimation algorithms including the traditional machine learning algorithm, Naive Bayes, FM, DeepFM and other algorithms. Finally, I adopted the scheme of the Alibaba team - Alibaba's Easy REC, which is a beginner-friendly machine learning framework.</p>



                            <p>Later on, I faced a more challenging task - the construction of an offline and real-time data warehouse for our big data project. I have always been intrigued by this field. In fact, I even proposed to my leader to be transferred to the big data department. However, my request was initially denied. Fortunately, when the company underwent some adjustments, my wish came true and I was finally transferred to the big data team. It seems that they were hoping my expertise in server-side development could bring fresh possibilities and enhance our data service capabilities. My initial foray into the realm of big data involved constructing a robust and efficient data warehouse. The data warehouse follows the Lambda architecture, and I am responsible for handling the ETL process for offline data (using Aliyun's MaxCompute and DataWorks) as well as contributing to real-time data calculations using Flink. This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of data warehouse, afforded me the opportunity to tackle extensive scheduling and processing of offline data, and allowed me to leverage Flink for real-time data computations.</p>



                            <p>Currently, we are exploring the use of artificial intelligence in risk control. Our initial project involves determining whether multiple equipment data reports originate from the same device, which will provide valuable support for business operations, activity promotion and new app installation. Drawing on my previous experience with CTR estimation methods, I am grateful to have been given this opportunity by the company to explore this field further and appreciate their support during trial and error. However, there are challenges ahead - particularly when it comes to training ID data. For our first version, we utilized a siamese neural network that incorporated hashed device IDs directly into training in order to assess similarity between two devices. No matter how much we optimize our model, clean our data, or add value to our fields, the results will always be unsatisfactory. Later, it was realized that the training data were selected incorrectly. Due to the huge amount and uncertainty of device ID data, it was difficult to directly participate in the training. Later, it was changed to extract the features of each field of the two devices, such as consistency, distance, similarity, etc., and the extracted feature data was used in training in the deep neural network model. Finally, the result was a great breakthrough. Of course, this is only a small step, there are more problems and more business to explore in the future.</p>



                            <H3><dt><strong>My Life</strong></dt></H3>

                            <p class="drop-cap">Simple is the best. Life for me is all about embracing a low-key lifestyle. My dream home would be a spacious farm where I can raise animals and cultivate vegetables, creating a nostalgic connection to my hometown. Even though I have been away from home for over ten years, the picturesque scenery of that small town still lingers vividly in my mind.</p>


                            <H5><dt><strong>Hobbies</strong></dt></H5>

                            <p>I have a diverse range of hobbies, and sometimes I find myself refraining from exploring new interests due to limited space at home. Currently, my collection includes a saxophone, a guitar, two harmonicas, finishing material, sheets of leather, a box filled with accessories and tools, clay for sculpting, as well as paint and brushes. These items give you an idea of how I spend my time at home. Apart from playing different musical instruments (although I would love to learn drums if only there was enough room), I enjoy engaging in various activities. I take pleasure in decorating my home and crafting ornaments for tables, chairs, and stools. Additionally, I have a fondness for handwork, such as creating leather bags, clay dolls, and painting. These hobbies allow me to enjoy myself at home without the need to go out. It's not that I dislike socializing; rather, I simply prefer meaningful interactions. Fortunately, I am blessed with many wonderful friends with whom I frequently gather and engage in activities like basketball, billiards, hiking, and camping. Being surrounded by my friends always brings back the happiness and carefree spirit reminiscent of my college dormitory days.</p>
