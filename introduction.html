                            <H3><dt><strong>My Career</strong></dt></H3>



                            <p class="drop-cap">I am a software engineer who came to Beijing for university in 2010. Since graduating, I have been actively involved in software development here for nearly 10 years, and have worked on numerous projects encompassing various domains, including back-end, front-end, big data, and artificial intelligence. With each project came new breakthroughs and achievements. I consider myself a perpetual learner - One is never old to learn new skills. Currently, I am independently exploring the applications of AI in advertising and anti-cheating measures. It is my sincere hope to make progress alongside individuals who share similar interests.</p>



                            <p>My work experience can be divided into two stages. Prior to 2018, I primarily focused on Java back-end development and React front-end development. During this period, I worked on projects such as CRM, mobile office, and financial management, providing me a wealth of knowledge in computer science and allowing me to gain proficiency in various back-end and front-end frameworks. By exploring the source code of Spring and Netty, I developed a deeper understanding of software programming style and design patterns while also cultivating a strong interest in elegant code design. Moving forward on my software development journey, my focus lies in creating highly available and concurrent programs. Throughout this phase, I constantly seek new challenges to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. Additionally, these jobs served as opportunities for me to explore different career paths and find the direction for future professional growth through continuous experimentation.</p>



                            <p>The second stage spans from 2018 until now, worked at Beijing Digital Union Network Technology, during which I have been actively engaged in Java development, Python development, big data processing, and exploring the realm of artificial intelligence. These six years have undoubtedly posed as the most challenging period since my graduation.</p>

                            <h5><dt><strong> Accomplishment since 2018</strong></dt></h5>

                            <p>My first project in Digital Union is DSP. I am truly grateful for this opportunity participating in this high traffic project. The main challenge of this project was ensuring stable service for 10 billion AD requests per day while maintaining a response latency of less than 100ms for each request. I joined this project right from its first version and actively contributed towards subsequent launches by implementing various optimizations. These included utilizing local inverted index to promote ad library searches, optimizing program performance to enhance single service capacity, and employing elastic services for dynamic expansion and contraction. Three versions have been optimized just to improve performance. After the service is stable, it can undertake an average 10 billion requests daily, and the average delay of a single request is controlled within 60ms. In order to improve the effect of advertising, the last version of optimization began to explore artificial intelligence. I utilized machine learning and neural network to predict CTR, so as to improve the click-through rate and post-click conversion rate. Later, I explored CTR estimation algorithms including the traditional machine learning algorithm, Naive Bayes, FM, DeepFM and other algorithms. Finally, I adopted the scheme of the Alibaba team - Alibaba's Easy REC, which is a beginner-friendly machine learning framework and greatly improved the accuracy of CTR prediction.</p>



                            <p>Later on, I faced a more challenging task - the construction of an offline and real-time data warehouse for our big data project. I have always been intrigued by this field. My advantage in this project was that my expertise in server-side development could bring fresh possibilities and enhance our data service capabilities. My first project in the realm of big data involved constructing a robust and efficient data warehouse. The data warehouse follows the Lambda architecture, and I am responsible for handling the ETL process for offline data (using Aliyun's MaxCompute and DataWorks) as well as contributing to real-time data calculations using Flink. This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of data warehouse, afforded me the opportunity to tackle extensive scheduling and processing of offline data, and allowed me to leverage Flink for real-time data computations.</p>



                            <p>Currently, we are exploring the use of artificial intelligence in risk control. Our initial project involves determining whether multiple device data reports originate from the same device, which will provide valuable support for business operations, activity promotion and new app installation. Drawing on my previous experience with CTR estimation methods, I am grateful to have been given this opportunity by the company to explore this field further and appreciate their support during trial and error. However, there are challenges ahead - particularly when it comes to training ID data. For our first version, we utilized a siamese neural network that incorporated hashed device IDs directly into training in order to assess similarity between two devices. Due to the huge amount and uncertainty of device ID data, it was difficult to directly participate in the training. Later, it was changed to extract the features of each field of the two devices, such as consistency, distance, similarity, etc., and the extracted feature data was used in training in the deep neural network model. After optimization and data cleaning, finally, the result was a great breakthrough. Of course, this is only a small step, there are more problems and more business to explore in the future.</p>



                            <H3><dt><strong>My Life</strong></dt></H3>

                            <p class="drop-cap">Simple is the best. Life for me is all about embracing a low-key lifestyle. My dream home would be a spacious farm where I can raise animals and cultivate vegetables, creating a nostalgic connection to my hometown. Even though I have been away from home for over ten years, the picturesque scenery of that small town still lingers vividly in my mind.</p>


                            <H5><dt><strong>Hobbies</strong></dt></H5>

                            <p>I have a diverse range of hobbies, and sometimes I find myself refraining from exploring new interests due to limited space at home. Currently, my collection at home includes a saxophone, a guitar, two harmonicas, furnishing material, sheets of leather, a box filled with accessories and tools, clay for sculpting, as well as paint and brushes. These items give you an idea of how I spend my time at home. I enjoy engaging in various activities. I take pleasure in musical instruments, decorating my home. Additionally, I am interested in handwork, such as creating leather bags, clay dolls, and painting. These hobbies allow me to enjoy myself at home. It does not mean that I dislike socializing; rather, I simply prefer meaningful interactions. I am blessed with many wonderful friends with whom I frequently gather and engage in activities like basketball, billiards, hiking, and camping. Being surrounded by my friends always brings back the happiness and carefree spirit reminiscent of my university days.</p>

                            <H3><dt><strong>Self-evaluation</strong></dt></H3>
                            <p>I have always been deeply fascinated by the world of computers and have aspired to make a meaningful contribution to the industry. When choosing my undergraduate major, despite having six major choices available for each school, my determination led me to select the computer as my sole option. I successfully completed my studies in software engineering and enjoyed a fulfilling career for approximately ten years, during which I experienced great happiness, as I find joy in pursuing a career aligned with my passion.</p>
                            <p>My enduring commitment to computer science has been a consistent advantage, evident throughout my undergraduate education and nearly a decade of work experience in programming and data science. Over the past ten years, I have embraced various challenges with a passion for this industry, constantly exploring and innovating. I have maintained an unwavering enthusiasm for learning and a relentless eagerness for knowledge, firmly believing that one is always young enough to acquire new skills. I hope my extensive industry experience in this field can contribute significantly to the future academic and professional community by introducing new possibilities and values.</p>
