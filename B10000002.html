                                <li><h3>Stateless</h3></li>
                                <p>If the designed application is stateless, it facilitates horizontal scaling. In practical production environments, applications might be stateless, but configuration files may have state. For instance, different data sources need to be read for different data centers, which requires specification through configuration files or configuration centers.</p>

                                <li><h3>Decomposition</h3></li>
                                <p>During the initial system design, one must consider whether to create a large and comprehensive system or to decompose the system by functional modules based on the environment. For example, when developing a small-scale online tutoring system with limited user and transaction volumes and a single developer, it might not be necessary to decompose the system (e.g., into product, order modules). In contrast, a high-traffic system may benefit from functional decomposition.</p>

                                <p>Decomposition can occur based on various dimensions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>System Dimension: Decompose based on system functionality, such as product system, shopping cart, settlement, order system, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Functional Dimension: Decompose a system into functional sub-components, e.g., a coupon system can be split into coupon creation, coupon acquisition, and coupon redemption systems.</li>
                                    <li>Read/Write Dimension: Split based on read-to-write ratios. For example, a product system may be split into product write service and product read service, with the read service utilizing caching for performance improvement.</li>
                                    <li>AOP Dimension: Decompose based on access patterns. For instance, a product details page can be divided into a CDN system and a page rendering system.</li>
                                    <li>Module Dimension: Decompose based on basic or code maintenance features, following a three-tier architecture (Web, Service, DAO).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <li><h3>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</h3></li>
                                <p>Service-oriented architecture involves determining if simple single-point remote service calls are sufficient. If a single machine is inadequate, clustering can be considered. As the number of callers increases, automatic service registration and discovery (e.g., using Dubbo with ZooKeeper) should be taken into account. Additionally, service grouping/isolation for different callers, as well as considerations for later stages such as traffic control, black and white lists, etc., are essential. Fine-tuning details like timeout, retry mechanisms, service routing, and fault compensation should be addressed to ensure service quality.</p>
                                <p><strong>In summary: In-process services → Single-machine remote services → Manually registered clustered services → Automatically registered and discovered services → Service grouping/isolation/routing → Service governance (in parentheses).</strong></p>

                                <li><h3>Message Queues</h3></li>
                                <p>Message queues are employed to decouple services that do not require synchronous calls or subscribe to changes relevant to their systems. They facilitate service decoupling, asynchronous processing, and peak traffic buffering. For example, in an e-commerce system, many systems may subscribe to transaction order data, such as order processing, periodic delivery, order risk control, etc. Multiple mirror replications might be required for scenarios with a large number of subscribers to prevent a single message queue from becoming a bottleneck.</p>

                                <p>When using message queues, considerations should be given to handling production message failures and scenarios where messages are received multiple times. Some message queue products offer production retry functionality, notifying of production failures after a specified number of retries. In cases intolerant of production failures, follow-up data processing, such as adding logs and alerts, should be well-implemented. Regarding message duplication issues, especially with some distributed message queues, message duplication reception might occur in some scenarios due to performance and cost considerations. In such cases, anti-duplication handling should be implemented at the business level.</p>

                                <h4>4.1. Large Traffic Buffering</h4>
                                <p>During major promotions in e-commerce, advertising system traffic can surge several times or even dozens of times higher than normal. Special designs are required to ensure the system's smooth operation during this period, even if it means sacrificing strong consistency to guarantee eventual consistency.</p>
                                <p>When the interface which accept exposure request being called, storing ads information in both Redis and queues. The queues can be horizontally scaled into multiple tables to boost advertisement reception capability. Then a worker can Synchronize to databases.When the ads are clicked, the ads state will changes. However, the data might not have been synchronized to the database from the queue at this point. The state machine should retry based on the actual situation.</p>
                                <p>If a user views a single ad, it can be directly retrieved from the Redis. For ad list queries, considerations should be given to merging data from both Redis and the list.</p>
                                <p>The design of the synchronous worker should consider concurrent and duplicate processing, whether using single-machine serial scanning (each worker scans only a portion of the tables) or cluster processing (Map-Reduce). Additionally, it should consider whether to add relevant fields to the queues: handler (which application is processing), status (processing, processed, processing failure), last processing time (for dealing with timeouts), failure count, etc.</p>

                                <h4>4.2. Data Reconciliation</h4>
                                <p>In scenarios using asynchronous messaging mechanisms, there might be message loss, necessitating data reconciliation and correction to ensure data consistency and integrity. We should consider Periodic scanning of the original table, reconciliation of business data, and compensation for problematic data and define scanning interval based on the situation.</p>

                                <li><h3>Data Heterogeneity</h3></li>
                                <h4>5.1. Data Heterogeneity</h4>
                                <p>Advertisement sharding is typically based on advertisement IDs. To query a media placement list, data from multiple tables must be aggregated before returning. This aggregation can lead to low read performance for the advertisement table. To address this, it is necessary to perform data heterogeneity, such as creating a set of media placement tables based on placement IDs. Furthermore, archiving historical data should be considered to enhance service performance and stability. However, not all data heterogeneity is significant. For instance, stocking prices can be loaded asynchronously or merged for concurrent requests.</p>

                                <h4>5.2. Data Closed Loop</h4>
                                <p>Implementing a data closed loop, such as for a product details page with data sourced from multiple locations, involves storing and managing relevant data in a self-contained manner. This process generally includes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Data Heterogeneity:</strong> Receiving data changes through mechanisms like message queues and atomically storing them in appropriate storage engines, such as Redis or persistent KV storage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> Optionally aggregating data that has undergone heterogeneity. This aggregated data is typically stored in a KV storage system.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frontend Display:</strong> The frontend can retrieve all the necessary data in one or fewer calls.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The advantage of this approach is data closure, ensuring that any issues in dependent systems do not affect the working of the system, or if the system itself encounters problems, it does not affect other systems. Message queues are often used to distribute data in this manner.</p>

                                <li><h3>Cache Silver Bullet</h3></li>

                                <p>Browser-Side Cache: Set expiration times for requests, controlling through response headers like Expires and Cache-control. Suitable for less time-sensitive data, such as the framework of a product details page, merchant ratings, reviews, advertisements, etc. For high real-time data demands like prices and inventory, browser-side caching may not be applicable.</p>

                                <p>App Client Cache: To prevent instantaneous traffic surges during promotions, materials needed by the app, such as js/css/images, are typically pre-distributed to clients before the event. Additionally, caching first-screen data can provide fallback data for users in case of network anomalies.</p>

                                <p>CDN Cache: Consider pushing pages, activity pages, images, etc., to CDN nodes closest to users to improve data accessibility. Two common mechanisms are push (actively pushing content changes to CDN edge nodes) and pull (initially accessing edge nodes, sourcing from the origin server when content is absent). The choice depends on specific advantages and disadvantages. URL design for CDN usage should exclude random numbers to avoid bypassing CDN.</p>

                                <p>Access Layer Cache: For applications without CDN caching, consider using Nginx to build an access layer. Use mechanisms like URL rewriting, consistent hashing, proxy_cache, proxy_cache_lock, and shared_dict to implement caching. Considerations include URL rewriting sequences, consistency hashing based on parameters, memory-level/SSD-level proxy cache, lock mechanisms to merge multiple back-end calls, and shared_dict for caching when using Nginx+Lua architecture. Note that cache should not be applied to fallback (or degraded) or abnormal data to prevent long-term display to users.</p>

                                <p>Application Layer Cache: When using Tomcat, heap cache/external cache can be applied. Heap cache issues include cache loss on restart, posing a risk during traffic storms. Local Redis cache or shared dict can replace heap memory, or shared dict can be used in Nginx+Lua architecture for cache pre-placement, reducing the impact of storms.</p>

                                <p>Distributed Cache: In scenarios with limited data, discarding distributed caching for local Redis cache might be optimal. If data volume exceeds the capacity of a single server, shard the traffic to multiple servers or directly implement distributed caching. Commonly used sharding mechanisms include consistent hashing.</p>

                                <p>Firstly, the access layer (Nginx+Lua) reads from local proxy cache/local cache. If there is a cache miss, the access layer then reads from the distributed Redis cluster. If there is still a cache miss, it goes back to the Tomcat, then reads from the Tomcat application heap cache. If all caches miss, it calls the dependent business to get the data, then asynchronously writes to the Redis cluster. Lua-resty-lock non-blocking locks can be used during steps two and three to reduce peak traffic during cache misses, although their effectiveness depends on the specific scenario, especially in user-centric services.</p>

                                <li><h3>Concurrency</h3></li>

                                <p>If retrieved serially, it would take 60ms. However, if Data C depends on both Data A and Data B, and Data D is independent, while Data E depends on Data C, concurrent retrieval could reduce the time to 30ms, effectively doubling performance.</p>

                                <p>Assuming Data C also depends on Data F (5ms), and Data F is obtained in the Data C service, concurrent prefetching of Data F during the retrieval of Data A, B, and D can further reduce the overall time to 25ms.</p>
