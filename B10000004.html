                                <p>Internet black market attacks typically exhibit the following four typical characteristics:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Organized Crime:</strong> The black market has evolved from solo efforts to organized groups, working together through rational division of labor.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Specialization:</strong> Clear division of labor exists between the upper and lower tiers of the black market, with mutual collaboration and abundant criminal resources (such as identity cards, bank cards, phone numbers, mobile device IP resources, etc.). Some practitioners also possess high technical proficiency, excelling in various automation script writing, reverse engineering, and even the use of machine learning technologies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Strong Antagonism:</strong> The black market is familiar with mainstream risk control techniques, continually probing, challenging, and circumventing existing protective systems based on actual business situations.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cross-Industry Operations:</strong> Black market activities span across various platforms, including e-commerce, advertising, payments, and travel.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>To counter the rampant attacks of the internet black market and ensure the healthy development of businesses, it is necessary to establish a comprehensive prevention and control system covering the entire business process, forming an integrated anti-fraud solution of "terminal risk identification + cloud risk decision-making + AI."</p>

                                <p>This article will explore, from the perspectives of both Party A and Party B, how to create an anti-fraud system that covers the entire scenario and all business processes.</p>

                                <h2>1 Dynamic Prevention and Control Philosophy</h2>

                                <p>In the process of combating the black market, we have accumulated a lot of experience and lessons, resulting in a dynamic anti-fraud system that covers the entire business process, establishing capabilities spanning pre-event, in-event, and post-event stages.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>On terminal devices,</strong> device fingerprinting is used for device information collection, terminal intelligent computation, and cloud-based risk analysis. Rich risk labels are generated for each user's device for business decision-making.</li>
                                    <li><strong>During user-operated business processes,</strong> a decision engine calculates the risk level for each transaction. To ensure the richness and efficiency of decision engine strategies, real-time calculation systems are employed for metric computation. The decision engine can rapidly complete global strategy calculations through various indicators.</li>
                                    <li><strong>In the event of fraud cases,</strong> a comprehensive analysis conclusion is formed and organized into a case database. Simultaneously, tracing and evidence collection are conducted for potential legal processes.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>After establishing the entire prevention and control system, corresponding operational processes are needed to drive its normal operation and continuous evolution. Throughout the system's operation, a situational awareness system is used to monitor the overall prevention and control effectiveness. Immediate alerts are triggered when business indicators show unexpected fluctuations. Operational personnel evaluate the effectiveness of prevention and control using machine learning algorithms offline, combined with fraud intelligence, examining the entire system's prevention and control capabilities and areas of uncovered risks from the attacker's perspective. The goal is to create a dynamic, closed-loop, and ever-evolving system through operational driving and red-blue confrontation.</p>

                                <h2>2 Construction of Prevention and Control System</h2>

                                <p>Through continuous practical application of anti-fraud principles, we have gradually built a three-tier anti-fraud prevention and control system, including the terminal risk control layer, the analysis decision layer, and the data profiling layer. Simultaneously, the threat intelligence system permeates these three layers.</p>

<!--
                                <img src="path/to/figure_3.2.png" alt="Figure 3.2: Anti-Fraud Prevention and Control System">
-->

                                <p>The terminal risk control layer is primarily composed of device fingerprinting, biometric probes, and intelligent captchas, with device fingerprinting being the most crucial component.</p>

                                <p>The core capabilities of device fingerprinting include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Collecting hardware information from devices to create a unique ID for each mobile device, which remains unchanged despite the user's daily device usage.</li>
                                    <li>Generating risk labels for each mobile device, marking potential business risks for analysis and decision-making.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Bio-probes</strong> comprehensively model terminal operations, sensor information, and other data through data collection. Machine learning is then employed to differentiate whether the business operations are carried out by humans or automated tools. On the other hand, <strong>intelligent captchas</strong> are a common risk control tool essentially used to distinguish whether the business operations are performed by humans.</p>

                                <p>While bio-probes and intelligent captchas have similar functionalities, they are used in different scenarios. Bio-probes are suitable for detecting machines in all business scenarios, while intelligent captchas are designed to counteract machine bulk behavior in specific scenarios, requiring user interaction such as dragging and clicking. Bio-probes can automatically identify bots in the background without affecting user interaction, whereas intelligent captchas can impact user interaction experience negatively. By leveraging the results from bio-probe identification, captchas are not shown to normal users, and challenges are initiated only for suspicious users. The combination of both can achieve effective risk control while maintaining a good user experience.</p>

                                <p>The <strong>analysis decision layer</strong> serves as the central hub for aggregating various data, rules, and models. When a business request is sent to the decision engine, the system conducts rule judgments and model computations on business data, data collected from the terminal layer, and generated device risk labels and system risk data labels. This happens in an extremely short time to determine whether to block the business request. For business risk scenarios that can be judged afterward, the offline risk decision system handles post-event judgments.</p>

                                <p>The real-time metric calculation system of the analysis decision layer provides crucial support for the decision engine's speed. This system precomputes complex operations based on the decision engine's strategy configuration. For instance, a configured strategy may require calculating the number of times an IP appears over an extended period and analyzing the number and risk distribution of user accounts associated with that IP during this time window. Without precomputing relevant metrics, the decision engine would face significant time overhead, making it challenging to achieve real-time risk control.</p>

                                <p>The <strong>risk situational awareness system</strong> focuses on macroscopic statistical analysis. It utilizes various data, including core business data, device information, and risk decision results, to perform real-time, H+1, T+1, and other cycle combinations of analysis calculations through preset analysis algorithm models. Its core function is to perceive, display, and predict the changing trends of risk events in the entire business system. When unexpected fluctuations occur in risk decision results, operators must manually analyze cases of strategy. Operators combine data analysis with the offline calculation results of underlying machine learning to update risk models and adjust the risk strategies of the decision engine in real-time. While optimizing risk strategies, the risk situational awareness system also provides warnings for black market attack events.</p>

                                <p>The <strong>data profiling layer</strong> includes profiles of black market attack events, blacklisted phone numbers, IP profiles, and device profiles. Resources such as phone numbers, IP addresses, and mobile devices used by the black market are relatively limited and are repeatedly used for attacks on various internet platforms. In the process of providing SaaS prevention and control for multiple clients, accumulating risk data from the black market to form a profile system is a very effective "joint prevention and control" technical means.</p>

                                <p>The <strong>fraud intelligence system</strong>, as an important subsystem throughout the entire process, provides the ability to supplement and evaluate the overall prevention and control effectiveness from the "attacker's perspective." By monitoring the black market community, tracking black market dynamics, and conducting automated analysis, the fraud intelligence system can quickly identify weaknesses in the protection system, driving risk control operators to make targeted optimizations. As black market attack methods are constantly evolving, prevention and control strategies also need continuous upgrades.</p>

                                <h3>Conclusion </h3>

                                <p>This article briefly introduces the dynamic prevention and control philosophy derived from practical experience. Based on this risk control philosophy, we have built a business lifecycle risk control system that spans "pre-event, in-event, and post-event" stages. Through terminal risk identification capabilities, cloud intelligent decision-making, and black market data profiling, we achieve multi-level, all-scenario business risk control. Since the business models of internet companies differ, their risk control philosophies and operational approaches will also vary. Companies can construct a risk control system that matches their own by considering their business risk control goals, organizational structure, and resource investments.</p>
